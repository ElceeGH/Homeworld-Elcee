# Homeworld SDL

[SDL] port of the [Homeworld] source code that was [released in 2003] by [Relic].

## Installing

### Requirements

This repository contains only the source code for Homeworld's engine (metaphorically, the skeleton). In order to have a playable game, you will need the original assets (artwork, textures, sounds, meshes, ... Metaphorically again, the flesh).

So make sure you have:

- The Homeworld CD
- [The 1.05 Patch](http://www.homeworldaccess.net/downloads/hw1patch/si_homeworld_update_105.exe)

### Asset checklist

To sum it up, here are the files required for the game to run:

- [ ] `Homeworld.big`  
    > sha256: af9dcc06e3f99404334a0a8ec17e399876080e85feb5b47858382dc715136040
- [ ] `Update.big` (This comes from the official 1.05 Patch)  
    > sha256: c71b07758ee7696b3a19c1d75c946cbd68830e03b30cd3c2888f2f6d22b7c976
- [ ] `HW_Comp.vce`  
    > sha256: 15c4b988adb09b0969b0dc288b21ddc10ca9d42a2064d15b46b53dcf02fc2e44

- [ ] `HW_Music.wxd`  
    > sha256: b909c2cdbc8c8db67be168f6005bf8e8facaa9857263b16d186c824a0c4eed4f
- [x] `HomeworldSDL.big` (This file should be included in the [releases])

Usually you will find these files in your installation folder. For more detailed instructions, read on.

### Linux

#### Extracting game assets with wine

Install the game and patch with [wine] (tested with wine 4.1)

``` sh
wine HWSetup.EXE
wine si_homeworld_update_105.exe
```

Open the game installation folder (usually `~/.wine/drive_c/Sierra/Homeworld`). This is where you'll find the [required files](#asset-checklist). We'll be getting back at them later on.

#### Installing the binary distribution

1. Download [__the latest release__][releases]. (Extract it if necessary)
2. Copy [the files you gathered earlier](#extracting-game-assets-with-wine) in the folder you just downloaded
3. Run the game
4. Jump to [Configuring the OpenGL renderer](#configuring-the-opengl-renderer)

#### Compiling from source

> This is only a quickstart, more information can be found in the documentation files inside the [`Linux/`](Linux/) folder.

``` sh
cd Linux
./bootstrap
../configure --enable-x86_64
make
```

Now put the compiled executable `src/homeworld` in a directory with the [required assets](#asset-checklist).

For `HomeworldSDL.big` see [Packaging HomeworldSDL.big](#packaging-homeworldsdl.big)

You are now ready to run the game and [configure the OpenGL renderer](#configuring-the-opengl-renderer)

> The configuration step has a lot of flags, run `../configure --help` to see them. (Notably the `--disable-linux-fixme` flag)

##### Packaging HomeworldSDL.big

From the root of this repository:

``` sh
cd tools/biggie
./biggie-Linux-compile.sh
cd ../../HomeworldSDL_big
./convert_directory_to_big_file
```

You should now have a `HomeworldSDL.big`Â file in the root of the repo.

## Configuring the OpenGL renderer

The first time you run the game, you'll have to configure the renderer to use OpenGL. This will be saved in your `~/.homeworld`, so you won't have to do it every time you run the game.

Once the game has launched, you need to:

- Select "Options" from the main game menu.
- Select "Video" from the available option sub-menus listed on
    the right side of the screen.
- Select "(GL) Default OpenGL" from the "Rendering System" box.
- Choose a resolution from the "Resolution" box (any resolution
    you choose will do fine).
- Click on the "Accept!" button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

 The game will now attempt to switch to the OpenGL renderer.  
 If everything goes okay, you should be presented with a confirmation that the settings you requested were changed.  Select "Yes", and you should be ready to go!

## About

This source port exists thanks to the hard work of a few devoted fans and began in 2003, soon after [Relic] released their source code for Homeworld 1. And this even though __the code is not [libre]__. This code and all contributions to it still remain the property of [Relic] (see the [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) for details).

### [ThibaultLemaire/HomeworldSDL]

This repository, at the time of writing (2019/02/12), holds the most up to date code (to the author's knowledge), and is the only one to provide compiled binaries (see [releases]).

The owner is no expert in C and a latecomer to the homeworldSDL party, but intends to improve the documentation (such as this README) and make the project more accessible. Indeed, most of the resources that were previously available (such as compiled HomeworldSDL binaries), are now -- 15 years later -- down, so the author decided he had to do something about it.

This repository focuses on Linux support.

### [timdetering/HomeworldSDL]

This is the only remnant that the author could find of the HomeworldSDL source code that was previously hosted on svn (at least the only one that preserved the commit history).
