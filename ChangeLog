Homeworld SDL - Change log

* 0.2 (2003-11-23):
- Game no longer crashes during explosions (in the code, memcpy() was used
  where memmove() should have been used in etgCallbackOpen()
  (src/Game/ETG.c)).  This fix may also fix other unknown bugs and crashes in
  the game.
- Avoid using the same source and destination in strcpy() by passing a copy
  of lightCurrentLighting to lightParseHSF() in LoadLighting()
  (src/Game/SaveGame.c).
- Configuration settings will now load properly from
  ~/.homeworld/Homeworld.cfg
- Fixed a possible segmentation fault in fileSetPrependPath()
  (src/Game/File.c) from reading the length of a string within a dbgAssert(),
  which would not be compiled when HW_Release is defined.
  (Steve Freeland <caucasatron@yahoo.ca>)
- Resolution changes now work properly without needing to restart the game
  (menus, etc. now adjust properly).  Unfortunately, switching from OpenGL to
  software still causes graphics to be bunched up in the bottom left corner.
- The "/window" command-line flag now works.
  (Steve Freeland <caucasatron@yahoo.ca>)
- Converted the few C++ sources used (src/Game/KNITransform.cpp,
  src/SDL/avi.cpp, src/SDL/rinit.cpp) to C to eliminate the need to link to
  libstdc++.
- Relieve dependency on SDL 1.2.6 by removing references to SDL_LoadObject(),
  SDL_LoadFunction(), and SDL_UnloadObject() in src/rgl/kgl.c and
  src/SDL/sstglide.c.  While the code isn't as portable (uses functions
  specific to Windows and Unix-derivatives now), at least it should work with
  earlier versions of SDL 1.2.x.
- Modified save game code to be more portable.  Offsets to level state
  functions in memory are no longer saved in the save game file, as they are
  not portable across hardware platforms, operating systems, or compilers
  (including different compiler flags and possibly different versions of the
  same compiler).  Save games now use an index into a predefined array of all
  state functions, which is generated by kas2c.  The saved game version has
  also been changed (older saved game files will no longer be loaded).

* 0.1.1 (2003-10-11):
- Force ETG.c to compile without optimizations (was getting thrashed in
  optimization)

* 0.1 (2003-10-11):
- Initial release (no sound or network support, OpenGL rendering only)
