----------


update: hwsdl-win32 can now load into the training level ok, but you may  need to use some combo of
/window /noBG /nilTexture in command line options for hwsdl.exe. Nova: Personally, I don't need them, but /window is useful.

for all other modes (skirmish, SP) hwsdl currently crashes during level load.

//requirements
> libsdl 1.2.11
> ddraw.lib, only. if don't have then see *1.
or download some version of the DirectX sdk (dx9 sdk is around 158mb)

//notes
> if HW_Data environment variable is defined all homeworld data will be found via this variable. 
> if you get link errors referencing Direct3D, DirectDraw, etc, then download the small dx9 sdk package from *1
> kas2c isn't automatically run to generate the Mission & Tutorial code files, this should be implemented later.

//compilers tested
vc7.1 sp1 & vc7.1
vc8 pro sp1 beta & RTM (using temporary .big file search code workaround (so files can be found inside the .big file))

//OS tested for compiling & running
windows XP Pro SP2

//vc8 notes
> if you find that your vc8 compiled hwsdl exe won't run on a different machine, you may need this:
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (x86)
