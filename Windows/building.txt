
----------
building HWSDL (exe only) on windows XP SP2.


requirements:
> libsdl 1.2.11
> ddraw.lib, only. if don't have then see *1.
or download some version of the DirectX sdk (dx9 sdk is around 158mb)


compilers tested:
vc7.1 sp1 & vc7.1
vc8 sp1 beta & RTM (using temporary .big file search code workaround (so files can be found inside the .big file))
----------

Remember:
> if HW_Data environment variable is defined, all you need in the same dir as the exe are the librgl*.dll's.
Devstats/etc will be found via HW_Data.
