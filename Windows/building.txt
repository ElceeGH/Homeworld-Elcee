> MS visual c++ 2003 or 2005 (2005 express is free) or Mingw*2 using Msys or Cygwin
> libsdl 1.2.11
> ddraw.lib, only. if don't have then see *1.
or download some version of the DirectX sdk (dx9 sdk is around 158mb)

//notes
> if HW_Data environment variable is defined all homeworld data will be found via this variable. 
> if you get link errors referencing Direct3D, DirectDraw, etc, then download the small dx9 sdk package from *1
> kas2c isn't automatically run to generate the required Mission & Tutorial *.c code files, this should be implemented later.

//vc8 notes
> if you find that your vc8 compiled hwsdl exe won't run on a different machine, you may need this:
