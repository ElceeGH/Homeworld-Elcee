Known bugs (as of 2003-10-11):

- Software renderer currently does not render 3D graphics properly (looks like
  it's not rendering any 3D for the most part, with triangles popping at
  various times).

- Various warnings (i.e. MEX files not found) are given during level loading
  (single player game or training mission).  I'm not sure whether this is a
  bug with porting the game or with the original code.

- Switching resolutions (with the OpenGL renderer) will cause the front end
  to display incorrectly (user interface is off center, main menu displays
  with a black border if the new resolution is higher than the old
  resolution).  3D rendering is not affected.  Restarting Homeworld causes the
  new display settings to initialize correctly.
